# Contributing

Contributions are welcome — bug fixes, new features, documentation improvements, and examples.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vstorm-co/pydantic-deepagents.git
cd pydantic-deepagents
make install        # installs dependencies + pre-commit hooks
make test           # run the test suite
make all            # full check: format, lint, typecheck, security, tests
```

## Requirements for Every Pull Request

| Check | Command | Must pass? |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Tests (100% coverage) | `make test` | **Required** |
| Ruff lint + format | `make lint` | **Required** |
| Pyright type checking | `make typecheck` | **Required** |
| MyPy strict type checking | `make typecheck-mypy` | **Required** |
| Bandit security scan | `make security` | **Required** |

All checks also run automatically in GitHub Actions on every push and pull request.

## Test Policy

New functionality **must** include tests. The `coverage fail_under = 100` setting in `pyproject.toml` enforces this — untested code causes `make test` to fail.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`
2. Make your changes, including tests for any new functionality
3. Run `make all` locally and ensure everything passes
4. Open a pull request with a clear description of the change and why it is needed
